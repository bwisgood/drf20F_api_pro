# drf20F_api_pro

Before we just finish the [genius20Fv1.0](https://gitee.com/yuan_jia_technology/genius20F) project with django, 
my team member told me that we could use the `django_rest_framework` to develop and design our backends-split-frontends api interface

But I asked him
"Could you control this framework? And when you met some complicate problem, do you have enough confidence to solving it?"

"..."

I had thought of using the django-rest-framework, but I can't guarantee our project could push on schedule.
Now
We almost complete our project, by the interest prmopt.
And develop our interface more simplier

# Good Luck
